		<h2>Happy Anniversary My Dear...</h2>
		<p>Its been 5 years, and I still remember that day, the day I confess to you about the woman I like and now already become the woman I love. I still remember that morning,  on my way to class, I told you the truth, I told what my heart says. Its a miracle that you accept me, start to love me until now. I'm always love u no matter what happen, no matter where we are, I always belong to you, you always in my heart, no matter how far our distance. Thank you my dear for willing to share your love with me, to cry with me, to laugh with me, to support me when I have nobody to hold on to, thank you for every moment we have share. I hope our relationship will become better is husband and wife, where you become legal for me. Always imagine to have a happy family with you, have a bunch of kids, have a lovely home to live, have a lovely room to sleep, and have a lovely bed to lay down. Thank you for accept me eventhough you knew all my weakness. Thank you for staying up with me until now. forgive me for everything I have done that hurt you, from just a dip of pain to unbearable pain. I'm sorry for everything. I will try to improve myself, be better person and prepare for the our marriage</p>
